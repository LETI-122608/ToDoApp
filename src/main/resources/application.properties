# Instead, use Flyway or another controlled way of managing your database schema.

#   NETWORK CONFIGURATION (used by QRs in PDF + Tasks)
#
# Replace this with your LAN IP address so other devices
# (like your phone) can reach the app over Wi-Fi.
#
# --- How to find your LAN IP ---
# ? macOS:
#     Open Terminal and run:  ipconfig getifaddr en0
#     (or 'en1' if on Ethernet)
#
# ? Windows:
#     Open Command Prompt and run:  ipconfig
#     Look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter.
#
# Example:
#     app.public-base-url=http://192.168.1.37:8080
#
# Make sure your phone is on the same Wi-Fi network.
# ==========================================================


# Public base URL used inside QRs (set this to your LAN IP in dev, and to your domain in prod)
# e.g. http://192.168.1.50:8080  or  https://todo.yourdomain.com
app.public-base-url=http://192.168.1.254:8080

# If behind a proxy, let Spring honor X-Forwarded-* headers
